## code changes (besides Lambda based dissipation)
Added relative winds capability to point output ww3_ounp.ftn
( Original version of the model did not account for relative winds)

# Ouput parameters : 
# ww3_shel.inp and ww3_ounf.inp
WCC: whitecap coverage (fractional)
WVA: air entraiment rate (m/s)
# ww3_ounp.inp 
lof: Lambda(f,\theta)  (s /[m rad])   
--- see time_limited_runs/input/ww3_ounp_spec.inp (line 95 with extra T/F flag) 


## Test cases in Romero (2019; GRL) ##
#time-limited runs 
script: run_time_limited
To make run_time_limited executable type: chmod 700 run_time_limited
Edit the script (run_time_limited) selecting the wind speeds and combination of source terms desired.

# Romero, Lenain, and Melville 2017 
script: run_RLM2017
inputs and data for validation included in directory: RLM2017

## supporting MATLAB scripts:
The test cases include the following matlab scripts: 
1) read and plot Lambda: plot_Loc.m, plot_Loc_cf_RLM17.m
2) plot wcc: plot_whitecap_coverage_cf_RLM17.m
3) script to compute Lambda(f) from a frequency spectrum: Lambda_Sds_f_offline.m
