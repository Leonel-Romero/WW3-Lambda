Lambda based energy dissipation due to wave breaking according to Romero 2019 (GRL - in review)
By L. Romero (University of California, Santa Barbra)

Model dissipation coded as STX (user defined slot), wind input corresponds to that by Ardhuin et al. 2010 (JPO) - ST4

## code changes (besides Lambda based dissipation)

Added relative winds capability to point output ww3_ounp.ftn
( Original version of the model did not account for relative winds)

# Ouput parameters : 

# ww3_shel.inp and ww3_ounf.inp
WCC: whitecap coverage (fractional)
WVA: air entraiment rate (m/s)
FDB: energy dissipation due to whitecaps (W/m^2)
FOC: energy dissipation due to bottom induced breaking (W/m^2)
# ww3_ounp.inp 
lof: Lambda(f,\theta)  (s /[m rad])

# Test cases from Romero 2019 with supporting MATLAB scripts can be found in: ww3_lambda_cases.tar.gz

See: ww3_lambda_cases/cases/README

Refer to model manual ww3.v5.16.pdf for details on the model 

To install this version of the model:

1) untar wwatch3.v5.16.model.tar (i.e.,  tar -xvf wwatch3.v5.16.model.tar)
2) run script: install_ww3_loc  (i.e., ./install_ww3_loc) and follow the instructions
