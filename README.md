The latest release v1.1 fixes a major issue related to the direction of the modulation transfer function of the dissipation which originally used a scalar mean direction weighted by the energy spectrum which led to unrealistic growth of the spectral tail in conditions with misaligned winds and dominant waves. This latest release uses a scale-dependent mean wave direction weighed by the cumulative mean squared slope.
